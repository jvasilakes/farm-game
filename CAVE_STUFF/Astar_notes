Two lists:

1. (OPEN LIST) Stores all sqaures that are being considered.
2. (CLOSED LIST) Stores all squares that are NOT being considered.

Add current position to closed list.
Add all walkable tiles to open list.

Assign each open sqaure a score
Score consists of:
1. (G) Movement cost from start sqaure to current square.
2. (H) Estimated movement cost from current sqaure to destination square.

Calculating G:
Add 1 to movement cost of parent square.

Calculating H:
Distance from current square to destination square ignoring obstacles.

The Algorithm:

1. Compute score of each square on open list.
2. Get square (S) in open list which has lowest score.
3. Remove S from open list and add it to closed list.
4. For each square (T) that is walkable and adajacent to S:
	1. If T is in closed list -> ignore it.
	2. If T is not in open list -> add T to open list and compute score.
	3. If T already in open list -> Recompute score: if it is lower than before -> update it.
